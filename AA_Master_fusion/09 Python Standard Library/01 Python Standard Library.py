# A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in
# different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we donâ€™t need to
# write the same code again and again for different programs. Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of
# Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.
