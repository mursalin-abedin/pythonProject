# 01 Defining Functions
###A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

# #Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this
# problem:

##create a circle function
##create a color function
##Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.###
